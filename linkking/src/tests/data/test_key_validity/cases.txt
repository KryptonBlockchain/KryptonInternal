This folder contains keys with misc edge cases related to key signature validation.
Main keys are Alice, Basil and Claus.

Case1: 
Keys: Alice [pub]
Alice is signed by Basil, but without the Basil's key.
Result: Alice [valid]

Case2:
Keys: Alice [pub], Basil [pub]
Alice is signed by Basil, Basil is signed by Alice, but Alice's self-signature is corrupted.
Result: Alice [invalid], Basil [valid]

Case3:
Keys: Alice [pub], Basil [pub]
Alice is signed by Basil, but doesn't have self-signature
Result: Alice [invalid]

Case4:
Keys Alice [pub, sub]
Alice subkey has invalid binding signature
Result: Alice [valid], Alice sub [invalid]

Case5:
Keys Alice [pub, sub], Basil [pub]
Alice subkey has valid binding signature, but from the key Basil
Result: Alice [valid], Alice sub [invalid]

Case6:
Keys Alice [pub, sub]
Key Alice has revocation signature by Alice, and subkey doesn't
Result: Alice [invalid], Alice sub [invalid]

Case7:
Keys Alice [pub, sub]
Alice subkey has revocation signature by Alice
Result: Alice [valid], Alice sub [invalid]

Case8:
Keys Alice [pub, sub]
Userid is stripped from the key, but it still has valid subkey binding
Result: Alice [valid], Alice sub[valid]

Case9:
Keys Alice [pub, sub]
Alice key has two self-signatures, one which expires key and second without key expiration.
Result: Alice [valid], Alice sub[valid]

Case10:
Keys Alice [pub, sub]
Alice key has expiring direct-key signature and non-expiring self-certification.
Result: Alice [invalid], Alice sub[invalid]

Case11:
Keys Alice [pub, sub]
Alice key has expiring direct-key signature, non-expiring self-certification and expiring
primary userid certification. Result: Alice [invalid], Alice sub[invalid]

Case12:
Keys Alice [pub, sub]
Alice key has non-expiring direct-key signature, non-expiring self-certification and expiring
primary userid certification. Result: Alice [invalid], Alice sub[invalid]

Case13:
Keys Alice [pub, sub]
Alice key has expiring direct-key signature, non-expiring self-certification and non-expiring
primary userid certification. Result: Alice [invalid], Alice sub[invalid]

Case14:
Keys Alice [pub, sub]
Alice key has expiring direct-key signature, non-expiring self-certification and non-expiring
primary userid certification (with 0 key expiration subpacket). Result: Alice [invalid], Alice sub[invalid]

Case15:
Keys [pub, sub]
Signing subkey has expired primary-key signature embedded into the subkey binding.
Result: primary [valid], sub[invalid]
